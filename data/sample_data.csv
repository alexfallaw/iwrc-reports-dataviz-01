IL-2022_Sankaran,A hybrid plasma-electrocatalyst activated process for the synthesis of ammonia from air and water,13,"The proposed IWRC project is focused on the synthesis of ammonia from air and water at ambient conditions using only electricity. Almost all fertilizers are derived from ammonia, which is currently synthesized by the Haber-Bosch process, a process that is centralized and possesses a large carbon footprint. There has been growing interest in developing a sustainable approach to synthesizing ammonia. A key challenge has been activating the very inert nitrogen molecule. Here, we developed an asymmetric electrochemical reactor composed of an anodic plasma that reacts nitrogen and oxygen gas at the interface of water to produce nitrates, and a cathodic electrocatalyst film that reduces the nitrates to ammonia.",Base Grant (104b),"$10,000",Energy,Water Technology and innovation,agriculture,atmospheric deposition,conservation,Great Lakes,Upper Mississippi River,,Dr. R.

HABs result in significant changes to ecosystems, such as decreased levels of dissolved oxygen. HABs also affect water health since they can form toxic microcystins. WWTPs and farms in Illinois are currently under new regulatory pressure to reduce nutrient loading in waterways. Achieving these goals will require significant energy costs. This project focused on developing a new understanding of HABs by studying the nutrient dynamics in Long Lake and its watershed and developing a new technology to reduce energy usage in WWTPs by using machine learning and sensors.",Base Grant (104b),"$20,000",HABs; Water Challenges,Water Quality,surface water,wastewater,phosphorus,Great Lakes,Upper Mississippi River,"Long Lake, IL",Dr. David Lampert,Illinois Institute of Technology,,1,0,2,0,0,2 women students,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,7
IL_2021_Stillwell,Assessing the Feasibility of Non-Potable Water Reuse in Illinois,IL-13,"Some areas face traditional water scarcity challenges while other individual localities may lack access to water sources of sufficient quantity and/or quality. Conflicts over water resources are often driven by economic, political, and environmental concerns. One method to reduce these concerns is the reuse of reclaimed water (treated municipal wastewater) in agricultural, industrial, and electric power generation applications. We examine the key factors that contribute to the development and success of non-potable reclaimed water projects, identifying locations in the contiguous United States that have sufficient demand for reclaimed water and adequate supply of treated wastewater to meet a significant portion of these demands. Our non-potable water reuse assessment uses geographic information systems to produce decision-aiding maps of feasibility, using a data-driven approach to determine locations for further detailed study.

IL_2023_Li,Assessing the Vulnerability of Public Water Systems to Droughts with an Integrated Remote Sensing and Social Sensing Approach,12,"Many towns and small cities depend on local lakes and reservoirs for their drinking water. When droughts happen, these water sources can shrink, but it is often hard for communities to track how drought affects both the water supply and people’s daily lives. This project explored a new way to understand those connections by combining satellite data, computer models of water systems, and information from social media. Using this integrated approach, we studied how physical changes in the environment relate to public awareness and concern about drought. Satellite images helped us see how plants and water sources responded to dry conditions, while social media posts (like tweets) gave us clues about how people felt and reacted as the drought worsened. We found that as rainfall decreased, people talked more about drought on social media, and their posts showed growing concern. However, these reactions often came slightly  later than the first signs of drought in the environment, usually when dry conditions became visible in landscapes. This shows that public awareness tends to build as the effects of drought become more noticeable. Our study highlights how combining environmental data with social media information can provide a more complete picture of drought impacts. This approach can help water managers anticipate public concerns earlier, improve drought communication, and make better plans to protect water supplies. For impacts, one graduate student developed his master's thesis based on this project, and he is currently in the process of submitting it to a journal. We selected reservoirs from the Illinois Reservoir Observation Network. This approach is expected to bridge the gap between physical droughts and social responses from our communities.",Base Grant (104b),"$15,000",Water Challenges; Natural Hazards,Water Scarcity and Availability,water supply,drought,hydrology,Great Lakes,Great Lakes,Southern Illinois,Ruopu Li,Southern Illinois University,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,Thesis/Dissertation,"Akinde, Fisayo Akindele.

Despite these negative impacts, little is known about interactions between the over 140 invasive species in the Upper Mississippi River basins. Mollusks (including snails, mussels, and clams) compose a large part of invasive biodiversity in the Laurentian Great Lakes and the Big Rivers of the Midwestern United States. Reliable sampling methods are often impractical for small organisms occupying riverbeds. Additionally, little is known about the interactions among these invasive species and native biodiversity. We propose the establishment of a cost-effective, reliable method to detect DNA from all major mollusks in the Illinois River watershed. We then identify ecological correlates of invasion of each species, as well as their co-occurrence with other invasive species.

This project provides new insight into the efficacy of PFAS remediation using in-situ capping technologies to protect surface water resources from contaminated groundwater. The results are expected to be of value to communities that are at risk of exposure to PFAS. The objectives of the project are to: (1) build laboratory experimental systems to examine the effectiveness of caps for PFAS containment that include pore water upwelling, (2) develop methods to measure a wide range of PFAS in water samples, (3) present results of PFAS containment research to a wide range of researchers and professionals at a national conference.",Base Grant (104b),"$10,000",Water Challenges,Water Quality,TOXIC SUBSTANCES,SOLUTE TRANSPORT,GROUNDWATER,Great Lakes,Upper Mississippi River,,David Lampert,,2,0,1,1,,,NA,Journal Article or Report In-Prep,Analysis of a passive sampling device to assess the behavior of PFAS compounds in sediments,Not yet available.,,,1,,,"Additional USGS 104g grant ($250,000, expected December 2022) that follows on this research",,,,,David Lampert,,"$250,000",PFAS transport from contaminated areas to surface waters,9,5

We studied how different flow conditions can facilitate or deter the passage of aquatic invasive species, with the goal being to provide management decisions that will improve water resources at the regional scale, with particular focus in the Upper Mississippi River basin. The project addresses three research questions: (1) What relationships exist among aquatic invasive species in the Upper Mississippi basin and tributaries to the Great Lakes?; (2) Which flow conditions, when altered by aquatic organisms, can benefit or deter the passage and survival of other aquatic species?; and (3) How can direct and indirect effects from mitigation strategies benefit or hinder efforts to control other species. To systematically address these questions, we conducted a series of laboratory experiments to test surrogates of various species under various flow conditions, identifying the interactions between species at various scales.

IL_2024_Li,Enhancing Field-scale Drainage Mapping Through Geospatial Artificial Intelligence,12,"Accurate maps of how water flows across farmland are essential for managing flooding, soil erosion, and water quality. Modern LiDAR technology allows scientists to create very detailed digital elevation models (DEMs) of the land’s surface. These models can show small changes in elevation that influence how water moves. However, they also have one important limitation—many such DEMs have roads and other human-made structures that block or redirect water flow. This can lead to errors known as “digital dams,” which cause drainage patterns to be mapped incorrectly.This project used a geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) system to automatically map small-scale drainage networks across agricultural areas. Using deep learning methods, the system identifies where roads, ditches, and other features alter natural water flow. This approach improves both accuracy and efficiency compared with traditional hand-drawn drainage mapping. To test the method, the team used data from a watershed in southern Illinois and built computer-based hydrological models to see how different elevation data sources would affect streamflow predictions. The results showed that while high-resolution LiDAR data captures very fine land details, these details do not always make computer simulations more accurate. Surprisingly, standard USGS and ALOS elevation models sometimes performed just as well or better, depending on how they represented larger landscape patterns.",Base Grant (104b),"$15,000",Water Challenges,Water Technology and Innovation,surface water,models,hydrology,Great Lakes,Great Lakes,Southern Illinois,Ruopu Li,Southern Illinois University,1,0,1,0,0,1,,Thesis/Dissertation,"Akinde, Fisayo Akindele.

IL-2022_Rhoads,Evaluating Sources of Fine Sediment to Headwater Streams in Intensively Managed Agricultural Landscapes of Illinois,13,"Excessive input of fine sediment and absorbed phosphorus to streams is a leading pollutant of fresh water in the United States, adversely affecting the water quality for aquatic organisms and people. The input of sediment and associated phosphorus from farmed land to streams is known to vary spatially and temporally in relation to storm events of different magnitudes and intensities, but pathways of connectivity between farmed fields and streams remain poorly understood. The proposed study will evaluate the extent to which eroded soil and sediment-absorbed phosphorus enters headwater agricultural streams through different pathways during different runoff-producing events. Sediment tracing will be based on Beryllium-7 (7Be), which is readily adsorbed onto sediment, has a short half-life, and is an excellent event-based tracer of fine sediment flux during storm events. Samples of sediment will be collected from different source pathways and from the stream and analyzed for 7Be and phosphorus concentrations. Analysis will examine how the 7Be signatures of different source pathways, along with differing phosphorus concentrations of sediment in various pathways, compares to the concentrations of 7Be and phosphorus concentrations of sediment within the stream. Results will provide insight into the specific pathways by which eroded sediment enters the stream system—knowledge that will be valuable for guiding sediment and phosphorus management in intensively managed agricultural landscapes in Illinois.",Base Grant (104b),"$9,700",Water Challenges; STEM,Water Quality,sediments,surface water,geochemical processes,Great Lakes,Upper Mississippi River,Sangamon River Basin,Dr. Bruce Rhoads,University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,,1,0,2,0,0,"3 - one from underrepresented group, one international",Thesis/Dissertation,,,2023,inProgress,0,0,,Award,National Science Foundation,Competitive Research Experience for Undergraduates Award,2023,April,Anne Cooke,Student,"$6,000",Undergraduate student assisted with field work over the summer in part to try to accomplish project goals in absence of the PhD student whose research was supposed to be supported by project funds,20,8

The nature of trees in these 'riparian forests' is influenced by how often and how much water gets accumulated. Different areas of a floodplain will get different levels and durations of water accumulations, depending upon their closeness to the river and height with respect to the river. Low areas close to the river will be flooded more often than areas which are farther from the river and higher up. This  idea was the basis for the research, which utilized field measurements of tree characteristics (diameter at breast height, tree species, canopy area) to test whether tree characteristics vary with the frequency and duration of water accumulation.

We used a large experimental tank with either high or low flow to create a wide variety of velocities to choose from and the choice of either sand, pebble, or cobble substrates. Half of the experimental trials also contained native and nonnative mussels to assess whether choice of habitat differed when prey was available. From the experiments, we identified the range of velocities preferred and avoided by juvenile Black Carp and found that they preferred sand and cobble over the pebble substrate.

Crest Hill, IL has a legacy of PFAS contamination in its groundwater wells from manufacturing and disposal of firefighting foams. PFAS concentrations in the community’s drinking water wells exceed Illinois state remedial action levels. This PFAS contamination is migrating into protected wetland areas around the Des Plaines River. This project studies the PFAS movement from contaminated areas in Crest Hill by using field data, computer simulations, and a laboratory-scale model of the site. The results are expected to help develop strategies to contain the PFAS at the site and other places where PFAS moves into surface water bodies.",104g - PFAS,"$250,000",Water Challenges,Water Quality,PFAs,solute transport,sediments,Great Lakes,Upper Mississippi River; Great Lakes,Des Plaines River Basin,David Lampert,Illinois Institute of Technology,6,2,1,3,0,0,,Journal Article,"Tekogul, I., Lampert, D.J., Mohammadi, F., Sandhu, A., and Shapiro, M., The regulatory void in PFAS cleanup and remediation.

IL_2022_Tartakovsky,Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Parameter Estimation and Surrogate Modeling,13,"The goal of this proj(ect was to develop integrated data-driven modeling capabilities with physics constraints. This project advances methods for integrating data and models by using state-of-the-art physics-informed machine learning (ML) methods to improve the accuracy of model predictions through better model parameterization and uncertainty quantification. We developed (1) physics-informed ML (PIML) parameter estimation methods and (2) PIML surrogate models. In these models, the unknown parameter fields and state variables are modeled with deep neural networks (DNN) or conditional Karhunen–Loeve (KL) expansions. The main advantage of these methods is that they require a relatively small amount of data for training. This is because the physics constraints allow us to fill “gaps” in the data and make the surrogate models more accurate. We focus on surrogate models where inputs are functions rather than a finite number of parameters that could be an output of climate or socioeconomic models. Project deliverables include PIML codes for parameter estimation and surrogate modeling that can be integrated with the existing USGS computational models. To date, we have delivered three ML codes that differ in the way physics is enforced. These codes are described in the Product List section. These codes rely on MODFLOW to generate training data sets. The publication plan is to submit at least two papers, which will include one paper on parameter estimation and one paper on surrogate modeling. The submitted and published papers are listed in the Product List section.",Coordination Grant,"$200,000",Other; Other,Water Scarcity and Availability,groundwater,methods,models,Great Lakes,None of the Above,,Alex Tartakovsky,University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,2,0,0,2,0,0,,Journal Article or Report In-Prep,"Yuanzhe Wang, Yifei Zong, James L.

Hydropower reservoirs contribute large amounts of virtual water through evaporation. During droughts, water constraints can change both how power plants generate electricity and where electricity moves on the grid. In our work, we use different methods to calculate water consumption from hydropower generation and estimate historic electricity transfers on a monthly scale. Water consumption combined with monthly electricity transfers will help quantify how hydropower and the U.S. electricity grid respond to different climate conditions. These results can facilitate better planning for both water and energy under climate variability.",Base Grant (104b),"$15,000",Energy; Water Challenges,"Water Policy, Planning, and Socioeconomics",management and planning,models,drought,Great Lakes,None of the Above,continguous United States,Ashlynn Stillwell,University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,1,0,0,1,0,1,,Thesis/Dissertation,"Nugent, Jennifer Cathryn.

IL_2021_Wang,Triboelectric devices for water motion energy harvesting and self-powered sensing,IL-13,"Have you ever been “shocked” when you touched a car’s door handle or a doorknob? This happens because electrons move from one object to the other. In fact, when any two things come into contact, electrons can move from one to the other. This movement of electrons causes electricity. Depending on the objects’ characteristics, the amount of electricity produced differs. The two objects that come into contact don’t have to both be solid. In this project, we study these variations in electricity production by bringing various solid films – similar to cellophane – into contact with a range of liquids. Studying this phenomenon can not only help us better understand the fundamental properties of all the materials involved, but also help us build better sensors and energy harvesters. For example, devices for detecting water pollution and for producing electricity from the movement of natural water currents.",Base Grant (104b),"$9,999",Energy,,WATER QUALITY,,,Great Lakes,,,Yi-Cheng Wang,,3,0,2,1,,,NA,Journal Article,"Zhenhui Jin, Fujunzhu Zhao, Yanlin Lei, Yi-Cheng Wang, Hydrogel-based triboelectric devices for energy-harvesting and wearable sensing applications, Nano Energy, 95, 2022, 106988.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nanoen.2022.106988,,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,39,4
IL_2024_Sloan,Using Continuous Water Quality Monitoring Combined with Stratified Sampling to Assess the Presence of Emerging Contaminants in the Upper Illinois River,13,"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are of significant concern because of their persistence in nature and their potential carcinogenic effects.  The National Great Rivers Research and Education Center (NGRREC) examined how PFAS contaminants partitioned into four distinct hydrological compartments of the middle Illinois River floodplain near Hennepin, including (1) the main channel, (2) a connected backwater lake, (3) an adjacent floodplain wetland, and (4) a natural seep. Our objective was to determine how changing seasons and hydrological conditions impacted how PFAS are transported or sequestered in the river system. Results thus far indicate that the main channel of the Illinois River has the greatest variety of PFAS compounds (n = 8), followed by the Illinois River backwater bay (n = 4). From a seasonal perspective, the variety of PFAS chemicals detected in the Illinois River main channel was greater in the fall (n = 8) than in the following spring (n = 4). There also appears to be a seasonal aspect to the presence and concentrations of PFAS chemicals. Not only were more PFAS chemicals present in mid-autumn and mid-summer compared with early spring, but the concentrations were consistently higher. Four of the PFAS chemicals detected in the Illinois River main channel had previously been detected in an upstream public drinking water supply (PFBA, PFBS, PFOA, and PFOS), and three different PFAS chemicals were previously detected in a downstream public drinking water supply (PFHxA, PFPeA, and 6.2 FTSA). Finally, we analyzed PFAS chemicals in the sediment from each of the four riverine compartments listed above, but we found only one chemical (NEtFOSA) in the wetland adjacent to the river and another chemical (PFOS) in the main channel sediments.",Base Grant (104b),"$15,000",Other,Water Quality,PFAs,surface water,wetlands,Great Lakes,Upper Mississippi River,Middle Illinois River (Putnam County),John J Sloan,National Great Rivers Research & Education Center,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,40,38
2020IL103AIS,Water Quality as a Deterrent to the Movement of Invasive Fishes in the Illinois Waterway: Implications for the Upper Mississippi Basin,13,"The ""leading edge"" of silver carp in the Illinois River has stalled south of Chicago and has remained stable for a decade. Studies have suggested that contaminants in the Chicago Area Waterway System (CAWS) may be contributing to the stall, but this hypothesis has not been tested. This project sought to quantify the role of contaminants in deterring upstream movement of silver carp within the CAWS using three studies. In the first study, silver carp and one native species were exposed to CAWS water in a laboratory, and activity, behavior, avoidance, and metabolic rates were quantified. Results showed that silver carp experienced elevated metabolic rates and reduced swimming in CAWS water. The second study looked to quantify the molecular and histological responses of silver carp to acute exposure to CAWS water. For this, silver carp from the core population were exposed to CAWS water and olfactory and liver tissue were collected to quantify stress. Results showed that silver carp  olfactory tissue experienced an upregulation of stress indices when exposed to CAWS water. The third study collected silver carp from the Illinois River from the core to the ""leading edge"", and quantified molecular, histological, and physical indices of stress (in addition to gizzard shad). Results showed an upregulation in indices of stress in both gill and liver from silver carp at the leading edge, higher gill aneurysms, and higher injury scores. Together, results indicate a role for contaminants in CAWS water at deterring upstream movement of silver carp  within the CAWS.",104g - AIS,"$240,624",Other; Other,Watershed Function,aquatic invasive species,wastewater,ecology,Great Lakes,Upper Mississippi River,Illinois River,Cory Suski,University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,3,2,1,0,0,1,,Journal Article,"Schneider, A.
